<h2>10.Mumbai – Ahmedabad Bullet Train</h2><br>
The ambitious high-speed rail project is being developed at a cost of Rs 1.08 lakh crore. It is another upcoming mega project in India in which high-speed rail will cover the distance of approx 509 kms between Mumbai and Ahmedabad in just 3 hours.<br><br>

The design for the bridges, viaducts and tunnels was made by engineers based in Delhi, Mumbai and Japan.The corridor is 508.09 km long and passes the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat and the union territory of <mark>Dadra and Nagar Haveli</mark>. The alignment comprises 460.3 km of viaducts (90.6% of route length), 25.87 km of tunnels (5.1%), 12.9 km of cut and fill (2.5%) and 9.22 km of bridges (1.8%).A 21 km tunnel connects Thane and Virar, of which 7 km will be undersea. The corridor will begin at the underground station in the Bandra-Kurla Complex in Mumbai, and then traverse 21 km underground before emerging above ground at Thane’.<br><br>
Indian Railways proposes to operate two types of services on the corridor. A “Rapid Train” service with only two stops at Surat and Vadodara, and a slower service that halts at all stations. The “Rapid Train” would complete the journey in 2 hours and 7 minutes, while the slower service would take 2 hours and 58 minutes. In total, 70 daily services will be operated on the line, or 35 services in each direction with 3 services per hour during peak hours and 2 services per hour during off-peak hours.<br><br>
